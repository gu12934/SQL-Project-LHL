# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
In this project, we will combine and practice implementing what we have learned throughout this course, including:

Extracting data from a SQL database
Cleaning, transforming and analyzing data
Loading data into a database
Developing and implementing a QA process to validate transformed data against raw data

## Process
### Loading CSV tables into pgadmin

When loading CSV's into pgAdmin4:
1) right click your public schema. Click Create > Table
2) In the General Tab, name your new table the same as your CSV(i.e. all_sessions)
3) In the columns tab, create each column from your CSV file in the exact order it appears
4) Set each column data type to an acceptable type (remember to adjust Length/scale to either 255 or 550)
5) click save
6) navigate to tables on the left hand menu
7) right click your new table, and click import/export data

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning process
dealing with null values
Handle missing data - imputing missing values
address outliers - remove outliers
data normalization (changing data type)
duplicate data
data transformations

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
-had a lot of challenges with importing the data, writing a query to import it effectively

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
